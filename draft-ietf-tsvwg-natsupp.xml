<t>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) provides a reliable

even when two hosts (behind a NAT) choose the same port numbers for their
connection.
This additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
Translation (NAPT).</t>

<section title='Introduction'>
<t>Stream Control Transmission Protocol <xref target='RFC4960'/>
provides a reliable communications channel between two end-hosts in many
ways similar to TCP <xref target='RFC0793'/>. With the widespread
deployment of Network Address Translators (NAT), specialized code has been
added to NAT for TCP that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT
using private addresses (see <xref target='RFC6890'/>) and yet use only a
single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts
(behind a NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.
This additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
Translation (NAPT).
Please note that this document focuses on the case where the NAT maps a single
or multiple private addresses to a single public address and vice versa.
To date, specialized code for SCTP has not yet been
added to most NAT devices so that only a translation of IP addresses is
supported.
The end result of this is that only one SCTP-capable host can successfully
operate behind such a NAT and this host can only be single-homed.
The only alternative for supporting legacy NAT devices is to use
UDP encapsulation as specified in <xref target='RFC6951'/>.</t>
<t>This document specifies procedures allowing a NAT to support SCTP
by providing similar features to those provided by a NAPT for TCP and
other supported protocols.
The document also specifies a set of data formats for SCTP packets and a set
of SCTP endpoint procedures to support NAT traversal.
An SCTP implementation supporting these procedures can assure that in both
single-homed and multi-homed cases a NAT will maintain the appropriate state
without the NAT needing to change port numbers.</t>
<t>It is possible and desirable to make these changes for a number of reasons:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>It is desirable for SCTP internal end-hosts on multiple platforms to be able
to share a NAT's public IP address in the same way that a TCP session can use a
NAT.</t>
<t>If a NAT does not need to change any data within an SCTP packet it
will reduce the processing burden of NAT'ing SCTP by NOT
needing to execute the CRC32c checksum required by SCTP.</t>
<t>Not having to touch the IP payload makes the processing of ICMP
messages in NAT devices easier.</t>
</list></t>
<t>An SCTP-aware NAT will need to follow these procedures for generating
appropriate SCTP packet formats.</t>
<t>When considering this feature it is possible to have
multiple levels of support. At each level, the Internal
Host, External Host and NAT may or may not support the
features described in this document. The following table
illustrates the results of the various combinations of
support and if communications can occur between two endpoints.</t>
<texttable anchor='communication_table'
           title='Communication possibilities'>
<ttcol align='center'>Internal Host</ttcol>
<ttcol align='center'>NAT Device</ttcol>
<ttcol align='center'>External Host</ttcol>
<ttcol align='center'>Communication</ttcol>
<c>Support</c>    <c>Support</c>    <c>Support</c>    <c>Yes</c>

<c>No Support</c> <c>No Support</c> <c>No Support</c> <c>None</c>
</texttable>
<t>From the table it can be seen that when a NAT device does not support the
extension no communication can occur.
This assumes that the NAT device does not handle SCTP packets at all and
all SCTP packets sent externally from behind a NAT device are discarded by
the NAT.
In some cases, where the NAT device supports the feature but one of the two
hosts does not support the feature, communication may occur but in a
limited way.
For example only one host may be able to have a connection when a collision
case occurs.</t>

<section title='Motivation'>
<section title='SCTP NAT Traversal Scenarios'>
<t>This section defines the notion of single and
multi point NAT traversal. </t>
<section title='Single Point Traversal'>

<t>In this case, all packets in the SCTP association go through a
single NAT, as shown below:</t>
<figure title='Single NAT scenario'
        align='center'>
<artwork>

  Internal Network    |       External Network
                      |
+--------+            |               /--\/--\           +--------+

                      |
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>A variation of this case is shown below, i.e., multiple NAT devices in a
single path:</t>
<figure title='Serial NAT Devices scenario'
        align='center'>
<artwork>
      Internal | External : Internal | External
               |          :          |
+--------+     |          :          |       /--\/--\    +--------+
|  SCTP  |  +-----+       :       +-----+   /        \   |  SCTP  |
|endpoint|==| NAT |=======:=======| NAT |==| Internet |==|endpoint|

               |          :          |
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>Although one of the main benefits of SCTP multi-homing is redundant
paths, in the single point traversal scenario the NAT function represents
a single point of failure in the path of the SCTP multi-homed association.
However, the rest of the path may still benefit from path diversity provided
by SCTP multi-homing.</t>

<t>The two SCTP endpoints in this case can be either single-homed or
multi-homed. However, the important thing is that the NAT device
(or NAT devices) in this case sees all the packets of the SCTP association.</t>

</section> <!-- title='Single Point Travers'-->

<section title='Multi Point Traversal'>
<t>This case involves multiple NAT devices and each NAT device only sees some
of the packets in the SCTP association.
An example is shown below:</t>
<figure title='Parallel NAT devices scenario'
        align='center'>
<artwork>

         Internal      |      External
                    +------+             /---\/---\
+--------+  /=======|NAT A |=========\  /          \     +--------+
|  SCTP  | /        +------+          \/            \    |  SCTP  |
|endpoint|/       ...                 |   Internet   |===|endpoint|
|    A   |\                            \            /    |    B   |
+--------+ \        +------+          / \          /     +--------+
            \=======|NAT B |=========/   \---\/---/
                    +------+
                       |
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>This case does NOT apply to a single-homed SCTP association (i.e.,
BOTH endpoints in the association use only one IP address). The
advantage here is that the existence of multiple NAT traversal points
can preserve the path diversity of a multi-homed association for the
entire path. This in turn can improve the robustness of the
communication.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title='Limitations of Classical NAPT for SCTP'>
<t>Using classical NAPT may result in changing one of the SCTP port numbers
during the processing which requires the recomputation of the transport layer
checksum by the NAPT device.
Whereas for UDP and TCP this can be done very efficiently, for SCTP
the checksum (CRC32c) over the entire packet needs to be recomputed.
See Appendix B of <xref target='RFC4960'/> for details of the CRC32c
computation.
This would considerably add to the NAT computational burden, however hardware
support may mitigate this in some implementations.</t>
<t>An SCTP endpoint may have multiple addresses but only has a single port
number. To make multipoint traversal work, all the NAT devices involved must
recognize the packets they see as belonging to the same SCTP association and
perform port number translation in a consistent way.
One possible way of doing this is to use a pre-defined table of ports and
addresses configured within each NAT.
Other mechanisms could make use of NAT to NAT communication.
Such mechanisms have not been deployabled on a wide scale base and thus are not
a recommended solution.
Therefore the SCTP variant of NAT has been developed.</t>
</section>

<section title='The SCTP-Specific Variant of NAT'>

<t>In this section it is allowed that there are multiple SCTP capable hosts
behind a NAT that has one Public-Address. Furthermore this section
focuses on the single point traversal scenario.</t>

<t>The modification of SCTP packets sent to the public Internet is
simple: the source address of the packet has to be replaced with the
Public-Address. It may also be necessary to establish some
state in the NAT device to later handle incoming packets.</t>

<t>For the SCTP NAT processing the NAT device has to maintain a NAT binding table
of Internal-VTag, Internal-Port, External-VTag, External-Port, Private-Address,
and whether the restart procedure is disabled or not.
An entry in that NAT binding table is called a NAT state control block.
The function Create() obtains the just mentioned parameters and returns
a NAT-State control block.</t>

<t>For SCTP packets coming from the public Internet the destination
address of the packets has to be replaced with the Private-Address
of the host the packet has to be delivered to. The lookup of the
Private-Address is based on the External-VTag, External-Port,
Internal-VTag and the Internal-Port.</t>

<t>The entries in the NAT binding table need to fulfill some uniqueness conditions.
There must not be more than one entry NAT binding table with the same pair of
Internal-Port and External-Port.
This rule can be relaxed, if all NAT binding table entries with the same
Internal-Port and External-Port have the support for the restart
procedure enabled.
In this case there must be no more than one entry with the same Internal-Port,
External-Port and Ext-VTag and no more than one NAT binding table entry with
the same Internal-Port, External-Port and Int-VTag.</t>

<t>The processing of outgoing SCTP packets containing an INIT chunk
is described in the following figure. The scenario shown is valid for all
message flows in this section.</t>

<t>Normally a NAT binding table entry will be created.</t>
<t>However, it is possible that there is already a NAT binding table entry with the
same External-Port, Internal-Port, and Internal-VTag
but different Private-Address.
In this case the INIT MUST be dropped by the NAT and an ABORT MUST be
sent back to the SCTP host with the M-Bit set and an appropriate error
cause (see <xref target='mbitabort'/> for the format).
The source address of the packet containing the ABORT chunk MUST be the
destination address of the packet containing the INIT chunk.</t>
<t>It is also possible that a connection to External-Address and External-Port
exists without an Internal-VTag conflict but there exists a NAT binding
table entry with the same port numbers but a different Private-Address.
In such a case the INIT MUST be dropped by the NAT and an ABORT SHOULD be
sent back to the SCTP host with the M-Bit set and an appropriate error
cause (see <xref target='mbitabort'/> for the format).</t>

<section title='Procedures for SCTP Endpoints and NAT Devices'>
<t>When an SCTP endpoint is behind an SCTP-aware NAT a
number of problems may arise as it tries to communicate with its peer:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>IP addresses can not not be included in the SCTP packet. This is
discussed in <xref target='setup'/>.</t>
<t>More than one host behind a NAT device could select the same VTag and source
port when talking to the same peer server. This creates a situation where
the NAT will not be able to tell the two associations apart. This situation
is discussed in <xref target='mbitport'/>.</t>
<t>When an SCTP endpoint is a server communicating with multiple peers and the
peers are behind the same NAT, then the two endpoints cannot be
distinguished by the server. This case is discussed in <xref target='collision'/>.</t>
<t>A restart of a NAT during a conversation could cause a loss of its state.
This problem and its solution is discussed in <xref target='restart'/>.</t>
<t>NAT devices need to deal with SCTP packets being fragmented at the IP layer.
This is discussed in <xref target='fragmentation'/>.</t>
<t>An SCTP endpoint may be behind two NAT devices providing redundancy.
The method to set up this scenario is discussed in
<xref target='multihomed'/>.</t>
</list></t>
<t>Each of these mechanisms requires additional chunks and parameters,
defined in this document, and possibly modified handling procedures
from those specified in <xref target='RFC4960'/>.</t>

<section anchor='setup'
         title='Association Setup Considerations for Endpoints'>
<t>The association setup procedure defined in <xref target='RFC4960'/>
allows multi-homed SCTP endpoints to exchange its IP-addresses by using
IPv4 or IPv6 address parameters in the INIT and INIT ACK chunks.
However, this doesn't work when NAT devices are present.</t>
<t>Every association setup from a host behind a NAT MUST NOT use multiple
private addresses.
There MUST NOT be any IPv4 Address parameter, IPv6 Address parameter, or Supported
Address Types parameter in the INIT chunk. The INIT ACK chunk MUST NOT
contain any IPv4 Address parameter or IPv6 Address parameter using non-global
addresses.
The INIT chunk and the INIT ACK chunk MUST NOT contain any Host Name
parameters.</t>
<t>If the association should finally be multi-homed, the procedure in
<xref target='multihomed'/> MUST be used.</t>
<t>The INIT and INIT ACK chunk SHOULD contain the Disable Restart parameter
defined in <xref target='disrestart'/>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor='mbitport'
         title='Handling of Internal Port Number and Verification Tag Collisions'>

<t>Consider the case where two hosts in the Private-Address space want to
set up an SCTP association with the same service provided by some hosts
in the Internet. This means that the External-Port is the same.
If they both choose the same Internal-Port and Internal-VTag, the
NAT device cannot distinguish between incoming packets anymore.
But this is very unlikely.
The Internal-VTags are chosen at random and if the Internal-Ports are
also chosen from the ephemeral port range at random this gives a 46-bit
random number that has to match.
A NAPT device can control the 16-bit Natted Port and therefore avoid collisions
deterministically.</t>

<t>The same can happen with the External-VTag when an INIT ACK chunk or
an ASCONF chunk is processed by the NAT.</t>

<section title='NAT Device Considerations'>
<t>If the NAT device detects a collision of internal port numbers and
verification tags, it MUST send an ABORT chunk with the M-bit set if the
collision is triggered by an INIT or INIT ACK chunk.
If such a collision is triggered by an ASCONF chunk, it MUST send an
ERROR chunk with the M-bit.
The M-bit is a new bit defined by this document to express to
SCTP that the source of this packet is a "middle" box, not the
peer SCTP endpoint (see <xref target="mbitabort"/>).
If a packet containing an INIT ACK chunk triggers the collision,
the corresponding packet containing the ABORT chunk MUST contain the same
source and destination address and port numbers as the packet containing
the INIT ACK chunk. In the other two cases, the source and destination address
and port numbers MUST be swapped.</t>
<t>The sender of the ERROR or ABORT chunk MUST include the error cause
with cause code 'VTag and Port Number Collision'
(see <xref target='port_coll'/>).</t>
</section>

<section title='Endpoint Considerations'>
<t>The sender of the packet containing the INIT chunk or the receiver
of the INIT ACK chunk, upon reception of an ABORT chunk with M-bit set
and the appropriate error cause code for colliding NAT binding table state is included,
SHOULD reinitiate the association setup procedure after choosing a new initiate
tag, if the association is in COOKIE-WAIT state. In any other state, the
SCTP endpoint MUST NOT respond.</t>

<t>The sender of the ASCONF chunk, upon reception of an ERROR chunk with
M-bit set, MUST stop adding the path to the association.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor='collision'
         title='Handling of Internal Port Number Collisions'>
<t>When two SCTP hosts are behind an SCTP-aware NAT it is possible that two
SCTP hosts in the Private-Address space will want to set up an
SCTP association with the same server running on the same host in the Internet.
If the two hosts choose the same internal port, this is considered an
internal port number collision.</t>
<t>For the NAT, appropriate tracking may be performed by assuring that the
VTags are unique between the two hosts.</t>
<section title='NAT Device Considerations'>
<t>The NAT, when processing the INIT ACK, should note in its NAT binding table that
the association supports the disable restart extension.
This note is used when establishing future associations (i.e. when processing
an INIT from an internal host) to decide if the connection should be allowed.
The NAT device does the following when processing an INIT:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>If the INIT is originating from an internal port to an external port for
which the NAT device has no matching NAT binding table entry,
it MUST allow the INIT creating an NAT binding table
entry.</t>
<t>If the INIT matches an existing NAT binding table entry, it MUST validate
that the disable restart feature is supported and, if it does, allow the INIT
to be forwarded.</t>
<t>If the disable restart feature is not supported, the NAT device MUST send
an ABORT with the M-bit set.</t>
</list></t>
<t>The 'Port Number Collision' error cause (see <xref target='portcollide' />)
MUST be included in the ABORT chunk sent in response to the INIT chunk.</t>
<t>If the collision is triggered by an ASCONF chunk, a packet containing an
ERROR chunk with the 'Port Number Collision' error cause MUST be sent in
response to the ASCONF chunk.</t>
</section>
<section title='Endpoint Considerations'>
<t>For the external SCTP server on the Internet this means that the
External-Port and the External-Address are the same.
If they both have chosen the same Internal-Port the server cannot distinguish
between both associations based on the address and port numbers.
For the server it looks like the association is being restarted.
To overcome this limitation the client sends a Disable Restart parameter in
the INIT chunk.</t>
<t>When the server receives this parameter it does the following:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>It MUST include a Disable Restart parameter in the INIT ACK to
inform the client that it will support the feature.</t>
<t>It MUST disable the restart procedures defined in <xref target='RFC4960'/>
for this association.</t>
</list></t>
<t>Servers that support this feature will need to be capable of maintaining
multiple connections to what appears to be the same peer
(behind the NAT) differentiated only by the VTags.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor='restart'
         title='Handling of Missing State'>
<section title='NAT Device Considerations'>
<t>If the NAT device receives a packet from the internal network
for which the lookup procedure does not find an entry in the NAT binding table,
a packet containing an ERROR chunk is sent back with the M-bit set.
The source address of the packet containing the ERROR chunk MUST
be the destination address of the incoming SCTP packet.
The verification tag is reflected and the T-bit is set.
Such a packet containing an ERROR chunk SHOULD NOT
be sent if the received packet contains an ABORT, SHUTDOWN COMPLETE
or INIT ACK chunk. An ERROR chunk MUST NOT be sent if the received
packet contains an ERROR chunk with the M-bit set.
In any case, the packet SHOULD NOT be forwarded to the external address.</t>
<t>When sending the ERROR chunk, the error cause 'Missing State'
(see <xref target='miss_state'/>) MUST be included and the M-bit of
the ERROR chunk MUST be set (see <xref target='mbiterr'/>).</t>
<t>If the NAT device receives a packet for which it has no NAT binding table entry
and the packet contains an ASCONF chunk with the VTags parameter, the NAT
device MUST update its NAT binding table according to the verification tags in
the VTags parameter and the optional Disable Restart parameter.</t>
</section>
<section title='Endpoint Considerations'>
<t>Upon reception of this ERROR chunk by an SCTP endpoint the
receiver takes the following actions:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>It SHOULD validate that the verification tag is reflected by looking
at the VTag that would have been included in the outgoing
packet.
If the validation fails, discard the incoming ERROR chunk.</t>
<t>It SHOULD validate that the peer of the SCTP association supports
the dynamic address extension.
If the validation fails, discard the incoming ERROR chunk.</t>
<t>It SHOULD generate a new ASCONF chunk containing the VTags parameter
(see <xref target='vtags-parameter'/>) and the Disable Restart
parameter (see <xref target='disrestart'/>) if the association is using the
disable restart feature.
By processing this packet the NAT device can recover the appropriate state.
The procedures for generating an ASCONF chunk can be found in
<xref target='RFC5061'/>.</t>
</list></t>
<t>The peer SCTP endpoint receiving such an ASCONF chunk SHOULD either
add the address and respond with an acknowledgment, if the address is
new to the association (following all procedures defined in
<xref target='RFC5061'/>).
Or, if the address is already part of the association, the SCTP endpoint
MUST NOT respond with an error, but instead SHOULD respond with an ASCONF ACK
chunk acknowledging the address and take no action (since the address is
already in the association).</t>
<t>Note that it is possible that upon receiving an ASCONF chunk containing
the VTags parameter the NAT will realize that it has an
'Internal Port Number and Verification Tag collision'.
In such a case the NAT MUST send an ERROR chunk with the error cause code set to
'VTag and Port Number Collision' (see <xref target='port_coll'/>).</t>
<t>If an SCTP endpoint receives an ERROR with
'Internal Port Number and Verification Tag collision' as the error cause
and the packet in the Error Chunk contains an ASCONF with
the VTags parameter, careful examination of the association is required.
The endpoint does the following:
<list style='symbols'>
<t>It MUST validate that the verification tag is reflected by looking
at the VTag that would have been included in the outgoing
packet. If the validation fails, it MUST discard the packet.</t>
<t>It MUST validate that the peer of the SCTP association supports
the dynamic address extension. If the peer does not support it, the NAT Device
MUST discard the incoming ERROR chunk.</t>
<t>If the association is attempting to add an address (i.e. following
the procedures in <xref target='multihomed'/>) then the endpoint MUST NOT
consider the address part of the association and SHOULD make no
further attempt to add the address (i.e. cancel any ASCONF timers and
remove any record of the path), since the NAT devie has a VTag collision
and the association cannot easily create a new VTag (as it would if
the error occurred when sending an INIT).</t>
<t>If the endpoint has no other path, i.e. the procedure was executed
due to missing a state in the NAT device, then the endpoint MUST abort the
association.
This would occur only if the local NAT device restarted and accepted a new
association before attempting to repair the missing state (Note that this
is no different than what happens to all TCP connections when a NAT device
looses its state).</t>

<section anchor='fragmentation'
         title='Handling of Fragmented SCTP Packets by NAT Devices'>
<t>A NAT device MUST support IP reassembly of received fragmented
SCTP packets. The fragments may arrive in any order.</t>
<t>When an SCTP packet has to be fragmented by the NAT device and
the IP header forbids fragmentation a corresponding ICMP packet SHOULD
be sent.</t>
</section>

<section anchor='multihomed'
         title='Multi Point Traversal Considerations for Endpoints'>
<t>If a multi-homed SCTP endpoint behind a NAT connects to a peer,
it MUST first set up the association single-homed with only one
address causing the first NAT to populate its state.
Then it SHOULD add each IP address using ASCONF chunks sent via
their respective NAT devices. The address to add is the wildcard address
and the lookup address SHOULD also contain the VTags parameter and
optionally the Disable Restart parameter.</t>

<section title='Various Examples of NAT Traversals'>
<t>Please note that this section is informational only.</t>
<t>The addresses being used in the following examples are IPv4 addresses
for private-use networks and for documentation as specified in <xref target='RFC6890'/>.
However, the method described here is not limited to this NAT44 case.</t>
<t>The NAT binding table entries shown in the following examples do not
include the flag indicating whether the restart procedure is supported or not.
This flag is not relevant for these examples.</t>

<section title='Peer-to-Peer Communication'>
<t>If two hosts are behind NAT devices and want to communicate with each other,
they have to get knowledge of the peer's public address.
This can be achieved with a so-called rendezvous server.
Afterwards the destination addresses are public,
and the association is set up with the help of the INIT collision.
The NAT devices create their entries according to their internal peer's
point of view. Therefore, NAT A's Internal-VTag and Internal-Port are
NAT B's External-VTag and External-Port, respectively.
The naming (internal/external) of the verification tag in the packet
flow is done from the sending host's point of view.</t>

<t>This section defines a YANG module for SCTP NAT.</t>
<t>The terminology for describing YANG data models is defined
in <xref target="RFC7950" />.
The meaning of the symbols in tree diagrams is defined
in <xref target="RFC8340" />.</t>

<section title=" Tree Structure">
<t>This module augments NAT YANG module <xref target="RFC8512" /> with
SCTP specifics.
The module supports both classical SCTP NAT (that is, rewrite port numbers)
and SCTP-specific variant where the ports numbers are not altered.
The YANG "feature" is used to indicate whether SCTP-specific variant is
supported.</t>
<t>The tree structure of the SCTP NAT YANG module is provided below:</t>

<t>Concretely, the SCTP NAT YANG module augments the NAT YANG module
(policy, in particular) with the following:
<list style="symbols">
<t>The sctp-timeout is used to control the SCTP inactivity timeout.
That is, the time an SCTP mapping will stay active without SCTP packets
traversing the NAT.
This timeout can be set only for SCTP.
Hence, "/nat:nat/nat:instances/nat:instance/nat:policy/nat:transport-protocols/nat:protocol-id"
MUST be set to '132' (SCTP).</t>
</list></t>

<t>In addition, the SCTP NAT YANG module augments the mapping entry
with the following parameters defined in <xref target='terminology' />.
These parameters apply only for SCTP NAT mapping entries (i.e.,
"/nat/instances/instance/mapping-table/mapping-entry/transport-protocol"
MUST be set to '132');
<list style="symbols">
<t>The Internal Verification Tag (Int-VTag)</t>
<t>The External Verification Tag (Ext-VTag)</t>

<section title='Security Considerations'>
<t>State maintenance within a NAT is always a subject of possible
Denial Of Service attacks. This document recommends that at
a minimum a NAT runs a timer on any SCTP state so that old
association state can be cleaned up.</t>
<t>For SCTP endpoints, this document does not add any additional
security considerations to the ones given in
<xref target='RFC4960'/>,
<xref target='RFC4895'/>, and
<xref target='RFC5061'/>.
In particular, SCTP is protected by the verification tags and the usage of
<xref target='RFC4895'/> against off-path attackers.</t>
<t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data that is
designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241" /> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040" />.
The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242" />.
The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
transport is TLS <xref target="RFC8446" />.</t>
<t>The Network Configuration Access Control
Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341" /> provides the means to restrict access for
particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all
available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.</t>
<t>All data nodes defined in the YANG module that can be created, modified,
and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default) are considered sensitive.
Write operations (e.g., edit-config) applied to these data nodes without proper
protection can negatively affect network operations.
An attacker who is able to access the SCTP NAT function can undertake various
attacks, such as:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Setting a low timeout for SCTP mapping entries to cause failures to deliver
incoming SCTP packets.</t>
<t>Instantiating mapping entries to cause NAT collision.</t>
</list>
